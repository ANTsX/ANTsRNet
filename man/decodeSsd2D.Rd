\title{Decoding function for 2-D Y_train}
\usage{
decodeSsd2D(
  yPredicted,
  imageSize,
  confidenceThreshold = 0.5,
  overlapThreshold = 0.45
)
}
\arguments{
\item{yPredicted}{The predicted output produced by the SSD model expected to
be an array of shape (\code{batchSize}, \code{numberOfBoxes},
\code{numberOfClasses} + 4 + 4 + 4)
where the additional 4's along the third dimension correspond to the box
coordinates (centerx, centery, width, height), dummy variables, and the variances.
\code{numberOfClasses} includes the background class.}

\item{imageSize}{2-D vector specifying the spatial domain of the input
images.}

\item{confidenceThreshold}{Float between 0 and 1.  The minimum
classification value required for a given box to be considered a "positive
prediction."  A lower value will result in better recall while a higher
value yields higher precision results.  Default = 0.5.}

\item{overlapThreshold}{'NULL' or a float between 0 and 1.  If 'NULL' then
no non-maximum suppression will be performed.  Otherwise, a greedy non-
maximal suppression is performed following confidence thresholding.  In
other words all boxes with Jaccard similarities > \code{overlapThreshold} will
be removed from the set of predictions.   Default = 0.45.}
}
\value{
a list of length \code{batchSize} where each element comprises a 2-D
array where each row describes a single box using the following six elements
(classId, confidenceValue, xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax)
}
\description{
Function for translating the predictions from the SSD model output to
boxes, (centerx, centery, width, height), for subsequent usage.
