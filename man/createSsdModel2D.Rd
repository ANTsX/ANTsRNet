\arguments{
\item{inputImageSize}{Used for specifying the input tensor shape.  The
shape (or dimension) of that tensor is the image dimensions followed by
the number of channels (e.g., red, green, and blue).  The batch size
(i.e., number of training images) is not specified a priori.}

\item{numberOfClassificationLabels}{Number of classification labels.
Needs to include the background as one of the labels.}

\item{l2Regularization}{The L2-regularization rate.  Default = 0.0005.}

\item{minScale}{The smallest scaling factor for the size of the anchor
boxes as a fraction of the shorter side of the input images.}

\item{maxScale}{The largest scaling factor for the size of the anchor
boxes as a fraction of the shorter side of the input images. All scaling
factors between the smallest and the largest are linearly interpolated.}

\item{aspectRatiosPerLayer}{A list containing one aspect ratio list for
each predictor layer.  The default lists follows the original
implementation except each aspect ratio is defined as a character string
(e.g. \verb{'1:2'}).}

\item{variances}{A list of 4 floats > 0 with scaling factors for the encoded
predicted box coordinates. A variance value of 1.0 would apply no scaling at
all to the predictions, while values in (0,1) upscale the encoded
predictions and values greater than 1.0 downscale the encoded predictions.
Defaults to 1.0.}
